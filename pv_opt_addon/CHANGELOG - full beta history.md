Improve error logging in ha_interface.py. 

Update Pv_opt to 5.1.6-Beta-2:
- Sunsynk bugfixes (https://github.com/stevebuk1/pv_opt/issues/424) - ensure Selltime3 is positive.

- Bugfix for "run_every callback error: unsupported operand type(s) for 'str' and 'int'" error (no issue raised)

## 1.0.5-Beta-2
Update Pv_opt to 5.1.6-Beta-1:
- Sunsynk bugfixes for Selltime3 (https://github.com/stevebuk1/pv_opt/issues/424)

## 1.0.5-Beta-1
Update Pv_opt to 5.1.5:

  Note: this is a partial fix and requires the use of the previous IOG tariff code being added to config.yaml.

- Updates to sunsynk.py to continue Inverter development (https://github.com/stevebuk1/pv_opt/issues/424)
- Remove inverter power cap when performing forced discharging at full rate (https://github.com/stevebuk1/pv_opt/issues/464)
- Do not automatically join Octopus Saving Sessions if Axle integration is installed (https://github.com/stevebuk1/pv_opt/issues/463)
- Resolve various MQTT issues (https://github.com/stevebuk1/pv_opt/issues/466, https://github.com/stevebuk1/pv_opt_app/issues/40,  https://github.com/stevebuk1/pv_opt_app/issues/39)

## 1.0.4-Beta-16
- Ensure MQTT STATE topic is updated by pv_opt for all entity changes received by pv_opt. 
- Correctly update both STATE and SET topics during startup, depending on whether overwrite_ha_on_restart is true or false — previously SET was never refreshed on startup overwrite, leaving stale retained commands that could be replayed and override config.yaml on a later restart.
Pv_opt updated to 5.1.3-Beta-14

## 1.0.4-Beta-4
- Sunsynk: Write battery current using service set_battery_settings instead of set_solar_settings
